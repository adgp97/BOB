Module "AD1"       (component ADC)
   - AD1_Measure -This method performs one measurement on all channels that are set in the component inspector. (Note: If the 
                <number of conversions> is more than one the conversion of A/D channels is performed specified number of times.)
   - AD1_GetValue -Returns the last measured values for all channels. Format and width of the value is a native format of the 
                A/D converter.
   - AD1_GetValue16 -This method returns the last measured values of all channels. Compared with <GetValue> method this method 
                returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD resolution> is less than 
                16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.
   - AD1_GetChanValue16 -This method returns the last measured value of the required channel. Compared with <GetChanValue> 
                method this method returns more accurate result if the <number of conversions> is greater than 1 and <AD 
                resolution> is less than 16 bits. In addition, the user code dependency on <AD resolution> is eliminated.

Module "AS1"       (component AsynchroSerial)
   - AS1_RecvChar -If any data is received, this method returns one character, otherwise it returns an error code (it does not 
                wait for data). This method is enabled only if the receiver property is enabled.  [Note:] Because the preferred 
                method to handle error and break exception in the interrupt mode is to use events <OnError> and <OnBreak> the 
                return value ERR_RXEMPTY has higher priority than other error codes. As a consequence the information about an 
                exception in interrupt mode is returned only if there is a valid character ready to be read.
   - AS1_SendChar -Sends one character to the channel. If the component is temporarily disabled (Disable method) SendChar 
                method only stores data into an output buffer. In case of a zero output buffer size, only one character can be 
                stored. Enabling the component (Enable method) starts the transmission of the stored data. This method is 
                available only if the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_SendBlock -Sends a block of characters to the channel.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output 
                buffer is defined and the transmitter property is enabled.
   - AS1_ClearTxBuf -Clears the transmit buffer.  This method is available only if non-zero length of the output buffer is 
                defined and the receiver property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInRxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the input buffer. This method is available only if the receiver 
                property is enabled.
   - AS1_GetCharsInTxBuf -Returns the number of characters in the output buffer. This method is available only if the 
                transmitter property is enabled.

Module "PTA6"      (component BitIO)
   - PTA6_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "PTA7"      (component BitIO)
   - PTA7_GetVal -Returns the input/output value. If the direction is [input] then the input value of the pin is read and 
                returned. If the direction is [output] then the last written value is returned (see <Safe mode> property for 
                limitations). This method cannot be disabled if direction is [input].

Module "TI1"       (component TimerInt)
   - TI1_Enable -This method enables the component - it starts the timer. Events may be generated (<DisableEvent>/<EnableEvent>)
                .

Module "Cpu"       (component MC9S08QE128_80)
   - Cpu_EnableInt -Enables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_DisableInt -Disables maskable interrupts
   - Cpu_Delay100US -This method realizes software delay. The length of delay is at least 100 microsecond multiply input 
                parameter [us100]. As the delay implementation is not based on real clock, the delay time may be increased by 
                interrupt service routines processed during the delay. The method is independent on selected speed mode.
